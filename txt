9-To create and manage your own ROS workspaces you have to install many tools or its called dependencies for building ROS packages

   then

    10-now we will install catkin which from it we can make workspace ,*notice*here i named the workspace by catkin_ws but you can name it anythig else if you want
    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-catkin
    then we will craet file inside it 
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
     then
      cd ~/catkin_ws/
     then we will install inside file src all the packages that related to arm
      catkin_make
      then 
      cd ~/catkin_ws/src
     then 
      git clone https://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm.git 
      then
      cd ~/catkin_ws
    then to install some packages from ros 
      rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
